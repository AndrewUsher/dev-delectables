# Maple Bacon Donuts

## Ingredients

- 6 slices bacon cooked and crumbled
- 1 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 cup bacon grease cooled (see note)
- 1 tablespoon butter at room temperature
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 3/4 cup sour cream
- 1/3 cup maple syrup
- 1 egg
- 1/2 cup maple syrup
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 2 tablespoons butter at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat two donut pans with non-stick cooking spray.
1. Place a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the bacon for 8-10 minutes, flipping as needed, until crispy. 1. 1. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Remove skillet from heat and let the bacon grease cool a little.
1. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Set aside.
1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the cooled bacon grease and butter until smooth. Add the brown and whisk until combined.
1. Add the sour cream, maple syrup, and egg and whisk for 2-3 minutes until very smooth.
1. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and whisk until combined.
1. Fill the donut pan cavities about 2/3 full with batter. Bake for 7-10 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
1. Remove donuts from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet for 10 minutes.
1. While the donuts are cooling, whisk together the maple syrup, powdered sugar, butter, and vanilla in a mixing bowl until smooth.
1. Chop the cooled bacon to use as sprinkles.
1. Dip a donut halfway into the glaze and then place it back on the wire rack so the glaze can run off onto the baking sheet. Sprinkle with chopped bacon. Repeat with remaining donuts, glaze, and bacon.
