# Triple Bacon Burger

## Ingredients

- 6 slices bacon cut in half
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 4 burger buns
- 4 slices Colby Jack cheese or your favorite cheese
- 4 leaves lettuce washed and dried
- Bacon Jam
- 1 clove garlic
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup mayonnaise
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 2 pieces cooked bacon finely chopped

## Instructions
 

1. Mince the garlic clove with a sharp knife. Sprinkle the salt over the garlic. Use the side of the knife to press down and crush the garlic & salt together. The salt will help break down the garlic. Re-pile and re-crush the garlic until it is a paste.
1. Mix together mayonnaise, garlic, lemon juice, salt, and pepper until well combined. Mix in bacon. Let rest in the fridge while preparing burgers.

1. Combine ground beef, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Portion ground beef into four 1/4 pound pieces, and form into patties; set aside.
1. Cook the bacon until crispy in a large skillet over medium heat. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate; set aside. Reserve 2 to 3 tablespoons bacon grease in the skillet.
1. Carefully place burger patties in the skillet (or cook on the grill). Cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side - burgers will be medium to medium-well done. 
1. Remove skillet from heat. Top burgers with cheese and cover the pan to melt the cheese, 1-2 minutes.

1. Place 1-2 tablespoons of aioli on the cut side of your bottom burger bun Using the back of your spoon spread out the aioli to coat the bun. Do the same with the Bacon Jam on the top bun. Add extra jam and aioli to your taste - you can't have too much of this jam. Top the aioli with a piece of lettuce, a cheeseburger, and 3 bacon slice halves. Place the top bun on the burger and you are in bacon burger heaven, my friend! This burger would go fabulously with some skinny fries or sweet potatoes fries.
