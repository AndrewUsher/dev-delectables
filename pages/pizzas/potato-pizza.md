# Potato Pizza

## Ingredients

- 1 lb. pizza dough (or half my no knead pizza dough recipe)
- ⅔ cup sour cream + more for serving
- ¾ teaspoon oregano
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ pound baby red potatoes, sliced ⅛"-1/16" thick
- ½ red onion, thinly sliced
- 3 cups mozzarella cheese
- 8 oz. crispy, crumbled bacon
- 4 stalks thinly sliced green onion
- Kosher salt
- fresh cracked pepper
- cornmeal for dusting

## Instructions

1. Heat oven to 550 degrees. Roll out your pizza dough into 2 (10-12 inch) circles. 
2. Dust a baking sheet with cornmeal and place crust on pan. Poke it all over with a fork. Bake for 5 minutes.
3. Divide sour cream evenly between both pizzas, spreading it an even layer. Then top with minced garlic. 
4. Spread 1 cup of cheese across each pizza crust in an even layer. 
5. Divide the sliced potatoes between the two pizzas, placing them in a single layer, slightly overlapping.
6. Sprinkle potatoes with oregano, and a large pinch of salt and pepper. Top with sliced red onion. 
7. Divide remaining cheese evenly between the two pizzas.
8. Bake for 12-14 minutes or until the cheese on top is just starting to melt and the edges are getting golden brown and crisp.
9. Remove pizzas from oven and divide crumbled bacon between them. Bake for another 4-5 minutes.
10. Garnish pizza with thinly sliced green onion and a drizzle of sour cream
