# Sirloin Steak Sandwiches

## Ingredients

- 1 cup distilled white vinegar
- 1 cup water
- 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 medium red onion, halved and thinly sliced
- Cooking spray
- 1 pound sirloin steak
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/3 cup mayonnaise
- 1/4 cup whole-grain mustard
- 1 1/2 cups arugula
- 4 onion rolls, sliced in half lengthwise

## Instructions


1. Place the vinegar, water, sugar, and salt in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. 
2. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar. 
3. Place the onion in a heatproof bowl and pour the pickling liquid over it; set aside while you cook the steak.
4. Arrange a rack about 4 inches from the broiler and heat the broiler to high. 
5. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. 
6. Coat a wire rack with cooking spray and fit over the baking sheet.
7. Pat the steak dry with a paper towel. Season both sides with the salt and pepper and place on the wire rack.
8. Broil (the steak should be 1 to 2 inches from the broiler's heating element) for 5 minutes. 
9. Flip the steak and continue broiling until well-browned and charred at the edges, 4 to 5 minutes more for medium-rare, or 6 to 7 minutes more for medium.
10. Let the steak rest for 10 minutes on the rack.
11. Whisk the mayonnaise and mustard together in a small bowl. 
12. Drain the onions through a fine-mesh strainer and discard the liquid. 
13. Transfer the steak to a cutting board and thinly slice across the grain.
14. Spread a thick layer of Dijon mayonnaise on the cut sides of the rolls.
15. Divide the steak and arugula between the rolls and close them to form sandwiches.
