# Steakhouse Skewers

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 pounds New York strip steak, cut into 1 1/4-inch cubes
- 1 large red onion, cut into 1 1/4-inch cubes
- 1 pound halved baby potatoes, parboiled
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 8 (10-inch) skewers (soaked for at least 30 minutes if wooden)
- 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
## Instructions

1. Heat a grill to high, direct heat.
2. Toss the steak, onion, potatoes, olive oil, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. 
3. Thread onto the skewers, about 9 pieces per skewer.
4. Melt the butter in a small saucepan on the grill.
5. Add the garlic and simmer until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. 
6. Remove the garlic butter from the grill.
7. Oil the grill grates. 
8. Place the skewers on the grill, cover, and cook until the beef is seared and cooked to desired doneness, 4 to 5 minutes per side, occasionally brushing both sides of the skewer with the garlic butter.
