# Pancake Syrup

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup butter
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1 Tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda

## Instructions

1. Start by melting the butter in a large saucepan.  (Make sure your saucepan is large because the sugar will foam and rise significantly once you add the baking soda).
1. Add the sugar, buttermilk, vanilla, and cinnamon and whisk to combine.
1. Bring the mixture to a boil, and once boiling turn it down to simmer for 2 minutes while whisking constantly.
1. Add the baking soda and cook for 30 more seconds, whisking constantly. (This is where you will notice the syrup foam and rise)
1. Remove the syrup from the heat and allow to rest for a couple minutes before serving. Serve homemade syrup warm of store it in the refrigerator.
