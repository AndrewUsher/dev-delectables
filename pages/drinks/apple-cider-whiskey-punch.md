# Apple Cider Whiskey Punch

## Ingredients

- 1 gala apple
- 1 orange
- 1 lemon
- 2 cups apple cider (the cloudy kind)
- 2 cups ginger ale
- 1 cup whiskey or bourbon
- 1/4 cup lemon juice

## Instructions
 
1. Core apple and cut into small chunks. Cut orange and lemon into thin slices to create wheels, and discard ends. Put fruit into a 2.5-quart pitcher.
1. Pour apple cider, ginger ale, whiskey, and lemon juice into the pitcher. Use a bar spoon or long wooden spoon to stir everything together.
1. Refrigerate the punch for at least 1 hour to let the flavors marry together.
1. Pour punch into glasses and spoon some apples and a fruit slice into each glass. During the fall and winter months, I add a cinnamon stick for garnish too.
