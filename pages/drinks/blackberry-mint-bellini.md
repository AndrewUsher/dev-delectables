# Blackberry Mint Bellini

## Ingredients

- 6 ounces fresh blackberries or frozen & thawed berries is you're in a bind
- 1/4 cup fresh mint leaves
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1500 mL bottles good quality brut champagne (equivalent to two 750 mL bottles-you can also use prosecco)
- Fresh mint sprigs for garnish

## Instructions
 

1. To a food processor, add the blackberries, mint leaves, and sugar. Cover and puree until smooth and combined.
1. Let the puree sit for 2 minutes so the flavors can marry together.
1. Press the puree through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the seeds and the majority of the fruit pulp. (You can store the puree in an airtight container in the fridge for 1-2 days if needed.)
1. Pour 1/2 ounce of the blackberry mint puree into a champagne flute.
1. Fill the glass with champagne or prosecco. (You'll want to pour a little, let the bubble die down, and then pour some more until the glass is full.)
1. Garnish with a sprig of mint, if desired, and serve immediately.
