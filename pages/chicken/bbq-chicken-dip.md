## BBQ Chicken Dip

## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups shredded rotisserie chicken
- 2 8 oz. blocks cream cheese, softened
- 1/3 cup ranch dressing
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin
- 3/4 cups your favorite BBQ sauce
- 2-4 teaspoons hot sauce, or more to taste
- 1 cup freshly grated sharp cheddar cheese, divided
- 1/2 cup freshly grated mozzarella cheese
- 1 green pepper thinly sliced then halved
- 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced then halved

## Instructions

1. Add cream cheese to a mixing bowl and beat until smooth. Add sour cream, ¾ cup BBQ sauce, ranch, cumin and hot sauce to taste and beat until smooth. Stir in ½ cup sharp cheddar cheese.
1. Add mixture to a lightly greased oven proof 10″ round skillet or baking dish that is at least 8″x8″ and 4″ deep and spread out evenly. 
1. Top with remaining ½ cup sharp cheddar cheese, followed by the red onion, green peppers, chicken, and mozzarella cheese (I save a few red onions and green peppers to throw ontop of the chicken layer purely for looks). Season with garlic salt.
1. Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes OR until hot in the center.
1. Optional: Drizzle with extra barbecue sauce, top with bacon and cilantro.
1. Serve as a dip with crackers/chips or as a spread with bread. Best served warm.
