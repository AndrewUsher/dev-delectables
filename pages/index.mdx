# Welcome to Dev Delectables

*Howdy!* I’m happy you’re here. Either way, I’m a self-taught front end developer and cook in training in Tennessee. I started this blog in 2021 and named it after a word I had no idea existed until the pandemic started last year. Now, I've learned a little bit and want to share new recipes!

I've become totally obsessed with food over the past few months. I daydream about new recipes. I devour cookbooks (I even wrote my own). I read up on food policy and nutrition. I love cooking food and hope my recipes inspire you to step into the kitchen to cook a delicious, healthy meal.

This blog is all about celebrating good food—real, sustainable food that delights the senses and nourishes the body.
